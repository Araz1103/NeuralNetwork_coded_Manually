# NeuralNetwork_coded_Manually
Python code implementing a framework to create Neural Networks with any number of layers and activations.

Additional Features implemented:
L2 Regularisation with Frobenius Norm (Cost Function needs to be updated, BackProp is fine)
Mini-Batch GD
Stochastic GD (Change Batch Size to 1)
Batch GD(Vanilla GD)


#Problem Statement:
Low Birth weight (LBW) acts as an indicator of sickness in newborn babies. LBW is closely
associated with infant mortality as well as various health outcomes later in life. Various studies
show strong correlation between maternal health during pregnancy and the childâ€™s birth weight.
We use health indicators of pregnant women such as age, height, weight, community etc in order
for early detection of potential LBW cases. This detection is treated as a classification problem
between LBW and not-LBW classes

You have been provided with a Dataset consisting of data collected from a hospital which
classifies the patient as cases of LBW and cases of non-LBW.

This is a design assignment that requires you to design a neural network from scratch using
only numpy. You are expected to submit a working code on the dataset provided to you
